<h3 class="history">Pizza is a popular dish that originated in Italy and has since become a beloved food around the world. The classic pizza consists of a thin crust made of flour, water, yeast, and salt, topped with tomato sauce and cheese. From there, the toppings can vary widely, with options including meats such as pepperoni or sausage, vegetables like mushrooms or onions, and even fruits like pineapple. The pizza can be baked in a wood-fired oven, a conventional oven, or even on a grill. Pizza is often served as a fast and casual food, but can also be found at high-end restaurants or made at home from scratch. Its versatility and simplicity make it a favorite for many people, and it continues to evolve and adapt to new tastes and trends.</h1>
