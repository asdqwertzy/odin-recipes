<h2 class="history">Tres Leches is a popular Latin American dessert that translates to "three milks." The dessert is made with a light, airy sponge cake that is soaked in a mixture of three types of milk: evaporated milk, condensed milk, and heavy cream. The cake is then topped with whipped cream and served cold. Tres Leches is known for its sweet, rich flavor and moist texture. It is often served at special occasions such as birthdays, weddings, and holidays. While the origins of Tres Leches are debated, it is believed to have originated in Central America and has since become a beloved dessert throughout Latin America and beyond.</h2>

<h3 class="headings">Preparation</h3>
<h4>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).<br>
    Grease and flour a 9x13 inch baking pan.<br>
    In a medium bowl, whisk together 175g all-purpose flour and 1 teaspoon baking powder.<br>
    In a large mixing bowl, beat 5 eggs with 200g white sugar until light and fluffy.<br>
    Stir in 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract.<br>
    Gradually mix in the flour mixture and 125ml whole milk until just combined.<br>
    Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the surface with a spatula.<br>
    Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.<br>
    While the cake is baking, combine 1 can (370ml) evaporated milk, 1 can (410ml) sweetened condensed milk, and 250ml heavy whipping cream in a saucepan. Heat the mixture over low heat, stirring constantly, until well combined and heated through.<br>
    Once the cake is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool in the pan for 5-10 minutes.<br>
    Using a fork, poke several holes in the top of the cake.<br>
    Slowly pour the milk mixture over the cake, making sure to fill the holes.<br>
    Allow the cake to cool completely in the pan.<br>
    Cover the cake and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or overnight.<br>
    Serve chilled, optionally topped with whipped cream and fresh fruit. Enjoy!<br></h4>
