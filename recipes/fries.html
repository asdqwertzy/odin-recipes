<h2 class="history">French fries, also known as chips, are a popular snack or side dish made from deep-fried potatoes. Originating in Belgium in the late 17th century, they quickly spread to other countries and became a staple in fast-food restaurants around the world. The process of making French fries involves cutting potatoes into thin, elongated strips and deep-frying them until they are crispy and golden brown. The fries are typically served with salt and a variety of condiments such as ketchup, mayonnaise, or vinegar. French fries can be made in a variety of ways, including oven-baked, air-fried, or deep-fried. They are often enjoyed as a comfort food and are a popular accompaniment to hamburgers, hot dogs, and sandwiches. While they are not the healthiest of foods due to their high fat and calorie content, French fries remain a beloved treat for many people around the world.</h2>
<h3 class="headings">Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Potatoes (preferably Russet or Idaho)</li>
    <li>Vegetable oil (or other frying oil of your choice)</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Optional: other seasonings or dipping sauces of your choice (such as ketchup or garlic aioli)</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="headings">Preparation</h3>
<h4>Peel the potatoes and cut them into thin, even strips. You can use a mandolin or a sharp knife to achieve uniform thickness.<br>
    Soak the potatoes in a bowl of cold water for 30 minutes. This will remove excess starch and help them crisp up when fried.<br>
    Drain the potatoes and pat them dry with a clean towel.<br>
    Heat the oil in a deep fryer or a large pot over medium-high heat. The oil should be hot enough to fry the potatoes but not so hot that it smokes.<br>
    Add a small batch of potatoes to the hot oil and fry until golden brown and crispy. Use a slotted spoon or a wire mesh skimmer to remove them from the oil and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil. Repeat until all the potatoes are cooked.<br>
    Season the fries with salt and any other desired spices, such as garlic powder or paprika.<br>
    Serve the French fries hot with your favorite dipping sauce, such as ketchup, mayonnaise, or aioli. Enjoy!<br></h4>
